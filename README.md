## Requirements

1. Have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).
2. Have a MyScript developer account. You can create one [here](https://developer.myscript.com/support/account/registering-myscript-cloud/).
3. Get your keys and the free monthly quota to access MyScript Cloud at [developer.myscript.com](https://developer.myscript.com/getting-started/web)

## Installation

iinkTS can be installed with the well known package managers `npm`, `yarn`.

If you want to use `npm` or `yarn` you first have to init a project (or use an existing one).

```shell
npm init
OR
yarn init
```

You can then install iinkTS and use it as showed in the [Usage](https://github.com/MyScript/iinkTS#usage) section.

```shell
npm install iink-ts
OR
yarn add iink-ts
```

## Usage

1. Create an `index.html` file in the same directory.

2. Add the following lines in the `head` section of your file to use iinkTS and the css :
```html
<script src="node_modules/iink-ts/dist/iink.min.js"></script>
```

3. Still in the `head` section, add a `style` and specify the height and the width of your editor:
```html
<style>
    #editor {
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
    }
</style>
```

4. In the `body` tag, create a `div` tag that will contain the editing area:
```html
    <div id="editor"></div>
```

5. In JavaScript and within a `<script>` tag placed before the closing tag `</body>`, create the editor using the Editor `constructor` function, your editor html element and a simple configuration, then initialize it:
```javascript
  const editorElement = document.getElementById('editor');

  const editor = new iink.Editor(editorElement, {
      configuration: {
          server: {
              applicationKey: '#YOUR MYSCRIPT DEVELOPER APPLICATION KEY#',
              hmacKey: '#YOUR MYSCRIPT DEVELOPER HMAC KEY#'
          }
      }
  });
  editor.initialize();
```

6. Your `index.html` file should look like this:
```html
<html>
    <head>
        <script src="node_modules/iink-ts/dist/iink.min.js"></script>
        <style>
            #editor {
                width: 100%;
                height: 100%;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="editor" touch-action="none"></div>
        <script>
            const editorElement = document.getElementById('editor');

            const editor = new iink.Editor(editorElement, {
                configuration: {
                    server: {
                        applicationKey: '#YOUR MYSCRIPT DEVELOPER APPLICATION KEY#',
                        hmacKey: '#YOUR MYSCRIPT DEVELOPER HMAC KEY#'
                    }
                }
            });
            editor.initialize();
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

7. Open `index.html` in your browser or serve your folder content using any web server.

Please take a look at our [contributing](https://github.com/MyScript/iinkTS/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines before submitting your pull request.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter the error: `Unrecognized property: convert.force`, this means your server version is lower than 2.3.0.
To correct the problem, you have 2 options:
- either update your server
- either add in the iink-ts configuration `configuration.server.version = 2.2.0`
