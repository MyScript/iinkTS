# Environment setup

## Configure project

1. Download sources
2. Install dependencies.
    * `npm install`
3. Build the project using our npm script.
    * `npm run build`
4. Run the server and the live reload using our npm script.
    * `npm run dev`. Examples will be available on `http://localhost:8000/examples/index.html`

**Start coding**

5. Debug using your favorite browser dev tools. The sources will be available under the webpack source folder (for chrome dev tools). Every change in sources will trigger a rebuild with linter and basic tests.
